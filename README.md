The sketch developer community has skyrocketed, bringing tons of awesome sketch plugins to the community. Sketch has also done a great job meeting the demands of the community releasing features like [libraries](https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/libraries/). The plugin landscape, however, has become hard to navigate with so many rapid changes and additions.

This is a curated list of plugins that really boost the capabilities of an already awesome app. Contributions are welcome! Please read [the contributions guide](contributing.md) before opening a PR.
